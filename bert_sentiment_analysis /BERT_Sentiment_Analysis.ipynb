        "3. `warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")`: This line sets up a filter to ignore all warnings generated by Python during the execution of the code. By using `\"ignore\"` as the argument, it suppresses all warnings from being displayed to the user. This can be helpful to prevent the console or notebook output from being cluttered with warnings, especially when they are not critical.\n",
